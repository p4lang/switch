Switch
=========

The switch repository contains the switch.p4 sample P4 program along with all the library repos to manipulate the switch using SAI, SwitchAPI and switchlink.

Running switch in bmv2 without p4factory
----------------------------------------
You can now run `switch.p4` in bmv2 without cloning `p4factory`. In order to do
this you first need to install [bmv2]
(https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model) and its compiler [p4c-bmv2]
(https://github.com/p4lang/p4c-bm) on your system. Note that when running
`./configure` for bmv2, you need to provide the `--with-pdfixed` option, as
switch requires the PD library. Additionally, if you plan on running the tests
for `switch.p4`, please make sure you install [PTF]
(https://github.com/p4lang/ptf) with `sudo python setup.py install`.

Once this is done, you can follow this steps:

     ./autogen.sh
     ./configure --with-bmv2 --with-switchsai
     make

The `--with-switchsai` flag will make sure that the compiled drivers include
`switchapi` and `switchsai`. If you just need `switchapi`, replace the flag will
`--with-switchapi`. Replace the flag with `--with-switchlink` if you need
`switchlink` as well. If you omit these flags, the drivers will only include the
`PD`.

Note that you should be using a fresh clone for this, not the `switch` submodule
that comes with `p4factory`.

Make sure to look at the output of `configure` to spot any missing dependency.

Once everything has compiled, you can run the tests for `switch.p4` (assuming
you have installed [PTF] (https://github.com/p4lang/ptf). Please make sure that
you have all the necessary veth pairs setup (you can use [tools/veth_setup.sh]
(tools/veth_setup.sh)).

First, start the software switch with:

       sudo ./bmv2/run_bm.sh

Then, start the drivers with:

       sudo ./bmv2/run_drivers.sh

You can now run all the tests:

    sudo ./bmv2/run_tests.sh  # for the PD tests
    sudo ./bmv2/run_tests.sh --test-dir tests/ptf-tests/api-tests  # for the switchapi tests
    sudo ./bmv2/run_tests.sh --test-dir tests/ptf-tests/sai-tests  # for the switchsai tests

Running switch with an openflow agent
--------------------------------------
You can now use [p4ofagent](https://github.com/p4lang/p4ofagent) to control switch.p4 on bmv2.
To do this, install p4ofagent with `CPPFLAGS=-D_BMV2_`, then configure switch with `--with-bmv2`
and `--with-of` options. You can run the tests with `sudo ./bmv2/run_of_tests.sh`, and you can also
play with a mininet-based l2-learning example by first building the switch docker image, then running
`sudo ./openflow_l2.py --controller-ip <ip>`, where `<ip>` is the ip address of a [Ryu](https://github.com/osrg/ryu)
instance running the [simple_switch_13](https://github.com/osrg/ryu/blob/master/ryu/app/simple_switch_13.py) app.

Building switch docker image
--------------------------------------

In addition to the setps in "Running switch in bmv2 without p4factory", 
configure bmv2 and p4c-bm with --prefix pointing to the install
directory and install. Also configure switch with --prefix pointing to
the install directory and --with-switchlink.

You can build the base docker image with:
    cd switch/docker/bmv2
    make -f docker.mk base-docker-image

This will build the docker image "p4dockerswitch".

    sudo docker images

Running switch ntf-tests
--------------------------------------

Switch NTF tests require NTF (Network Test Framework) and Docker image.

* Clone and install NTF (https://github.com/p4lang/ntf.git).
* Build switch docker image.
* Write topology, configs and tests as in switch/tests/ntf-tests.

You can now use NTF to build the topology required using the docker image and
write tests.

Below are some NTF tests and how to run:

L2: Simple L2 topology with two switches and two hosts. The topology is loop
    free (no spanning tree protocol).

    sudo ntf --topology switch/tests/ntf-tests/topology/l2_topology.json
    --config switch/tests/ntf-tests/topology/config.json --test-dir
    switch/tests/ntf-tests/ --test L2

STP: L2 topology with four switches and two hosts. It runs MSTPD to form a loop
     free topology.

    sudo ntf --topology switch/tests/ntf-tests/topology/stp_topology.json
    --config switch/tests/ntf-tests/topology/config.json --test-dir
    switch/tests/ntf-tests/ --test STP

L3 Static: Simple L3 topology with two switches and two hosts. The setup is
           statically configured.

    sudo ntf --topology switch/tests/ntf-tests/topology/l3_static_topology.json
    --config switch/tests/ntf-tests/topology/config.json --test-dir
    switch/tests/ntf-tests/ --test L3Static

L3 OSPF: Simple L3 topology with two switches and two hosts. The setup runs
         OSPF (Quagga) to learn and advertise networks.

    sudo ntf --topology switch/tests/ntf-tests/topology/l3_ospf_topology.json
    --config switch/tests/ntf-tests/topology/config.json --test-dir
    switch/tests/ntf-tests/ --test L3OSPF

L3 BGP: Simple L3 topology with two switches and two hosts. The setup runs
        EBGP (Quagga) to learn and advertise networks.

    sudo ntf --topology switch/tests/ntf-tests/topology/l3_bgp_topology.json
    --config switch/tests/ntf-tests/topology/config.json --test-dir
    switch/tests/ntf-tests/ --test L3BGP
