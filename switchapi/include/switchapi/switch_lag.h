/** @defgroup LAG LAG configuration API
 *  API functions listed to configure the Link Aggregation groups.
 *  Create LAG, Add/Del ports to LAG and set admin states
    Link aggregation allows for one or more ports to be treated as a single entity for reception
    and transmission of packets through the system. All behavior of packets on all the ports that
    belong to a group is identical on the device. The ports that belong to a single group can span
    multiple pipelines. Transmission of packets through particular ports is determined by the hashing
    scheme selectable globally. Typically the L2 fields (DMAC, SMAC, EtherType) are used for this.
    The choice of this is configurable by the APIs.
